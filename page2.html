        <h1>The Bozoros Manifesto</h1>
        <p>
          Bozoros is not just a coin. It is a symbol of a digital uprising, a statement of community power, and an embodiment of innovation through culture. Our manifesto defines our purpose, values, and the heartbeat of our movement.

        <h2>Decentralization for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in the power of decentralization—not just in technology, but in voice. Bozoros empowers its holders, creators, and supporters equally. We are governed by community and driven by shared purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>Memes are the Language of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
          Humor is powerful. Memes are relatable, emotional, and viral. At Bozoros, we embrace this energy to fuel movement, attract attention, and spread a powerful, positive message through fun.
        </p>

        <h2>Innovation through Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
          We embrace a minimalist and elegant approach in both design and technology. We believe the best systems are those that anyone can understand and everyone can trust.
        </p>

        <h2>The Future is Community-Owned</h2>
        <p>
          Bozoros is built by and for its people. No massive corporations, no middlemen—just us, together, building a culture-driven digital revolution.
